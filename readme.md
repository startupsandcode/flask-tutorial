# Flask Tutorial

This was based on the [Miguel Mega Flask Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

## Setup

setup your virutal environment
```
python -m venv venv
```

activate it
```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

pip install
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run it
```
flask run
```

## Debugging

There may be some clock issues because time.clock has been deprecated, so you can make those changes (simply change it to time.time)
